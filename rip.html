  title: Gender

  <!--description: <p class="simple-content">Games are about fun, friendship, and memories that remain long after the play is over. It is but natural that the immersive power of games is harnessed to address real-life issues. A lot of research has gone into understanding how games can be used in different situations and their potential is mostly untapped. Not only do games provide an inexpensive way of mimicking real-life situations, but they also allow us to learn and experience in a safe space, and the learning stays with us.</p><p class="simple-content"> At Fields of View, we create gaming-simulations â€“ games that can be used for learning and education; decision-making; and participatory planning.</p>-->

  <!--description: <p class="simple-content">Simulations model real world processes over time. With increasing computing power at our disposal, it is possible to simulate different real world scenarios. For instance, games such as SimCity are virtual simulations of cities and their inhabitants using cellular automata to model real processes. Engineering simulations such as wind tunnel simulations are used extensively to design and test the aerodynamic capabilities of aircrafts and auto mobiles. Immersive simulators such as flight and auto mobile simulators are used extensively by car manufacturers to train people and to improve and calibrate their designs.</p><p class="simple-content">Simulations are also widely used for planning purposes, such as resource planning, city planning, disaster and safety planning etc. Computer simulations present results in a visual interactive space. Our goal is to use computer and virtual simulations to understand and model the complexity of a problem in order to guide data collection, educate and train people and help in the decision making process.</p>-->

  <!--description: Based on our in-house interdisciplinary design research methodology, we offer different workshops and courses. The 'Fields of View' workshop is our most popular workshop to help define the problem and design in contexts where there are different perspectives/disciplines involved.  'Unpack Play' is our game design course. To know more, click on the images.-->

  <!--description: Bringing together diverse disciplines, we have developed products in-house to address social and technical challenges. Convers[t]ation is an ATM-like kiosk that can be installed in public spaces such as bus stops where women can come and report cases of sexual harassment. Phoenix is a platform for agent-based modelling. To know more, click on the images.-->

                <p class="simple-content" style="padding-top:20px">Can policymaking be made more relevant to the lives
                    of people affected by it? Can policymaking be more responsive to the constantly changing
                    social-economic-environmental context? Can we reduce the time taken for a policy to go from the
                    drawing board to implementation? The answer to all these questions is yes, provided we have the
                    right set of tools. Our goal thus at Fields of View is to undertake research at the intersection of
                    technology, social sciences, and art to design these tools for policymakers and people. We are a
                    not-for-profit group based in Bangalore.

                <p class="simple-content">Our work involves three inter-related threads:</p>
                <p class="simple-content"><b>Policy Lab</b>
                    <br>In the Policy Lab, we undertake research at the intersection of technology, social sciences, and
                    arts. We work in the areas of urban poverty, energy, transportation, disaster management, and water.
                    Our research involves creating and designing new methods and tools in the areas of simulations and
                    games.
                </p>
                <p class="simple-content"><b>School of Policy</b>
                    <br>Training programmes and workshops for government agencies and civil society organisations across
                    South Asia on these new tools and methods.

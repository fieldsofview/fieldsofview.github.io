abstract: Planning and Design of Energy Policy in India is a wicked problem, and  the  lack  of  awareness  about  its  complexity,  among  the  public  and  even among those with a working knowledge about the domain is an associated issue. In this paper  we  describe the Indian  Energy Game which is designed to address the above issues through game based experiential learning.

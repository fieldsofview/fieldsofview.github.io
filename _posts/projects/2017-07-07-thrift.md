description: <p class="simple-content">Given that India dreams of creating a 100 smart cities in the near future, the question of how city councils can fund this transformation becomes an urgent question for policymakers. The Central Government has proposed to provide financial support to the Smart City Mission to the tune of Rs. 48,000 crore over five years, which works out to an average of Rs. 100 crore per city per year. An equal amount, on a matching basis, will have to be contributed by the State/ULB (Urban Local Body)&#58; therefore, nearly one lakh crores of Central/State funds will be available for Smart Cities development. How can city councils work with this hybrid funding model&#63; How do different interest groups influence their decisions&#63; How can they retain flexibility, while facing the twin challenges of improving capabilities as well as increasing accountability? Thrift is a game designed by Fields of View that allows you to immerse yourself in these questions.</p>

intro: A game developed to help the audience understand the short-term and long-term dynamics of electricity and carbon markets.
description: <p class="simple-content">Electricity markets are influenced by transactions in the market, policy decisions, evolving institutions, unstable fuel prices, availability of fuel and advances in technology. These varying characteristics makes it difficult to analyse and understand the behavior of electricity markets. We developed the Electricity Market Simulation game as a space where participants play different roles of maket players and understand its behavior. The primary objectives of the game are:<ol> <li> To teach the dynamics of electricity markets.</li> <li>To analyse and understand the impact of various policies in such system.</li></ol><p/><p class="simple-content">Outputs include a game, game manuals, relevant documentation and analysis of game sessions.<p/>

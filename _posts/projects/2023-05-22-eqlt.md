intro: E-QLT is a tool designed to assess vulnerabilities and integrate social protection measures for households. By analyzing factors such as demography, income, expenditure, and access to social protection measures, E-QLT offers valuable insights into a household's vulnerability level.
description: <p class="simple-content">Vulnerabilities are temporal and dynamic in nature, and form an intricate web stemming from different dimensions, such as finance, caste, gender, education, health, and social capital. Schemes and policies are designed to help families and households to tackle vulnerabilities, but it is difficult to map how different schemes stitch together social protection for a particular household.</p> <p class="simple-content">Using a calculation known as the Social Protection Score, which functions similarly to a credit score, E-QLT measures the intensity of vulnerability and identifies the most effective schemes and benefits to enhance social protection.</p> <p class="simple-content">Key features of E-QLT&colon; <ul> <li>Simulates shocks and assesses the impact of schemes on households.</li> <li>Enables policymakers to make informed decisions and address gaps in social protection.</li> <li>Facilitates the crafting of targeted strategies for comprehensive social protection.</li> </ul> </p>E-QLT's approach&colon; <ul> <li>Uses system dynamic modeling to represent a household's state.</li> <li>Considers parameters like demography, income, expenditure, and access to social protection measures.</li> <li>Calculates a Social Protection Score with three dimensions&colon; Health, Education, and Finance.</li> <li>Scores are derived by running the model for 10 years, calculating monthly Social Protection Scores.</li> <li>Temporality and intensity of vulnerability are understood through this approach.</li> <li>Households with a Social Protection Score below 300 are considered vulnerable.</li> </ul> </p> <p class="simple-content">In summary, E-QLT, currently in development at Fields of View, is an innovative tool that evaluates vulnerabilities, calculates a Social Protection Score, and facilitates informed decision-making to strengthen social protection measures for households.</p> <p><a href="/publications/E-QLT-Report_Measuring-Vulnerability-to-Improve-Social-Protection_Fields-of-View.pdf" class="downloadbrochure">Read the E-QLT Report here.</a></p>

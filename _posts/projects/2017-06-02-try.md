intro: A study to understand the contribution of the urban poor to the economy and functioning of the city.
description: <p class="simple-content">The purpose of the study is to understand the contribution of the urban poor to the economy and functioning of the city. It focuses primarily on the linkages between shelter, mobility, and livelihoods in urban slums. In addition to documentation of infrastructural facilities being afforded to the slums, it also examines the current status and aspirational requirements of the slum residents. The study will assess the policy and the social implications of this analysis on our understanding of urban poverty and the evolution of slums.<p/>

The Poverty Study was conducted with the primary help of Mr. Issac Arul Selva, Mr. Issac Amruthraj and Mr. Vinay Sreenivasa.

description: <p class="simple-content">Project 560 is an initiative of India Foundation for the Arts to engage people with spaces, stories, and people of their neighbourhood in Bangalore. For Project 560, Fields of View is designing a game that will elicit stories about people’s experiences of the city. The game titled ‘Kattu Kathe‘ will engage diverse sets of participants, from different social, economic, and linguistic backgrounds. The game is being designed to question ‘standard‘ narratives of the city and explore how people’s personal narratives shape the narrative of the city.</p>
